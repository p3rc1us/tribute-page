    <em>“Ya, Professor, smile for your birthday picture, Ya?”</em>

    <p>The shot was taken on Einstein’s 72nd birthday right after an event in his honor was finished at Princeton on
      March
      14, 1951.

      While walking with Dr. Frank Aydelotte, the former head of the Institute for Advanced Study, and Mrs. Aydelotte
      back
      to their car, reporters followed trying to get shots of Einstein.

    Einstein's first major achievements came in 1905, when he published four groundbreaking papers, including his
    completion of special relativity.
    Ten years later he expanded that theory to include gravity, creating general relativity. The idea toppled Isaac
    Newton's physics and redefined our notion of space and time. It launched new strands of research that scientists
    are
    still pursuing and made its creator a star.
    Over the past century Einstein's ideas have intermingled with culture and art and shaped our world in infinite,
    indelible ways.

    <h4>COMICAL STORY ABOUT ALBERT EINSTEIN AND HIS DRIVER</h4>
    <p>One of the comical stories that have gone down in history features the famous scientists Albert Einstein and
      his
      driver. It all took place at the time the two were traveling around universities for the scientist to lecture on
      his famous theory of relativity.
      <br />
      <br />
      One day on their way to a university, his driver said to him, "Mr. Einstein, I've
      heard this lecture of yours more than 30 times. I've learned it by heart and I bet I could hold it myself".
      "Well,
      I'll give you the chance," Albert Einstein replied. "They don't know me at the next university, so when we get
      there I'll put your hat on my head and you introduce
      yourself as Einstein and hold the lecture," he continued.
      <br />
      <br />
      What Happened Next Is So Funny! At the lecture hall, the
      driver held Einstein's lecture flawlessly. When he finished, he wanted to leave, but one of the professors
      stopped
      him and asked him a very difficult question. The purpose of the question was not to accumulate knowledge but to
      make Einstein feel uncomfortable.
      <br />
    <h5>The driver thought quickly...</h5>
    "The answer to this problem is so simple..." he replied. "I'm surprised you have to ask me. In fact, to show you
    how simple it is, I'll get my driver to come over here and answer your question." Einstein then stood up and gave
    an incredible answer to the professor's question.
